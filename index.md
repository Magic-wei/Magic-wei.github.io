## About Me
Hello! My name is Wei Wang (王威).  I am a PhD candidate working under the supervision of Prof. Huiyan Chen in the Intelligent Vehicle Research Center (IVRC) at Beijing Institute of Technology. And I am also a visiting PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Steven L. Waslander in the Toronto Robotics and AI Laboratory (TRAILab) at University of Toronto.

My research interests cover the area of learning-based motion planning and control, model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning. My focus is more about learning-based motion control algorithms for better planning and control performance in off-road environment by considering reinforcement learning.

In the past three years, I have participated  in several projects and competitions for developing fully autonomous vehicles in passenger cars, minibus and also off-road vehicles.
