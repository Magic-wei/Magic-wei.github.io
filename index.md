## About Me
Hello! My name is Wei Wang (王威).  I am a PhD candidate working under the supervision of Prof. Huiyan Chen in School of Mechanical Engineering at Beijing Institute of Technology.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

My research interests cover the area of MPC-based motion planning and control, learning-based and adaptive control algorithms. My focus is more about learning-based motion control algorithms for better planning and control performance in off-road environment by considering reinforcement learning and Model Predictive Control (MPC).

In the past three years, I have participated  in several projects and competitions for developing fully autonomous vehicles in passenger cars, minibus and also off-road vehicles.
